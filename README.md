# Executive Intelligence Agent

An AI-powered executive decision support system that transforms raw business metrics into clear, actionable executive briefings.

## 🚩 Problem

Senior leaders are flooded with dashboards, reports, and KPIs, but still struggle to get **timely, actionable insights**.  
Traditional dashboards show *what* happened, but not:

- Why it happened  
- What risks it creates  
- What decisions should be taken next  

This leads to delayed decisions, cognitive overload, and missed opportunities.

---

## 💡 Solution

**Executive Intelligence Agent** is an AI-powered intelligence layer that automatically analyzes business metrics and generates **executive-ready overnight briefs**.

Unlike dashboards or rule-based alerts, the agent:
- Reasons over **changes, context, and impact**
- Produces **explainable insights**
- Recommends **clear next actions**

Executives get a concise briefing instead of raw data.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Business metrics are ingested (simulated using structured JSON data).
2. The AI analyzes:
   - Day-over-day changes
   - Trends and deltas
   - Business context
3. The system generates:
   - Key insights
   - Risks
   - Opportunities
   - Actionable recommendations
4. Results are presented in a clean web interface and via an API endpoint.
